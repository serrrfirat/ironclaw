# End-to-end: can an agent create a skill and can a LATER conversation use it?
#
# This is the loop #6941 item 4 (originally #7168) is about, and no hermetic test can cover it: it
# needs a live server, a real model, a restart, and two separate conversations. Every hermetic guard
# around it passed while the product was broken, because each one tested a layer in isolation:
#
#   * the mount views agreed in the shape the test constructed
#   * the install reported success
#   * discovery listed the tree the test had seeded
#
# The failure only appears when the writer and the reader are the real ones, chosen by the real
# composition, with a restart in between so nothing in memory can carry the result.
#
#   Phase A  a skill the agent authors from prose
#     A1  prompt 1 asks it to derive something and save a reusable skill
#     A2  the skill is listed in Settings -> Skills          (was: absent)
#     A3  the skill's SKILL.md is in the DATABASE, not on disk
#     A4  restart the server
#     A5  the skill is still listed                          (was: absent)
#     A6  a NEW conversation activates it                    (was: unactivatable, forever)
#
#   Phase B  a skill that carries a runnable script (the #6745 feature)
#     B1  prompt 1 asks for a skill including a Python script
#     B2  the bundle holds SKILL.md AND scripts/*.py in the database
#     B3  Settings reports has_scripts                       (was: hardcoded false)
#     B4  a NEW conversation activates it
#     B5  the script is EXECUTED from the bundle             <-- KNOWN GAP, see below
#
# B5 is expected to fail today and is reported, not asserted, unless
# E2E_REQUIRE_SCRIPT_EXEC=1. `builtin.shell` spawns a host process and the script exists only in the
# DB-backed virtual filesystem, so there is no host path to run. Observed: the agent tries
# `ls -la skills/<name>/<script>.py … || echo "NOT FOUND"` and then falls back to
# `python3 -c "<the algorithm re-typed inline>"`. Right answers, wrong mechanism -- and it defeats the
# argument for shipping a script, which is that prose lets the next run re-derive and drift. Set the
# env var once a fix lands, and this becomes a real assertion.
#
# Usage:
#   OPENROUTER_API_KEY=... scripts/e2e-skill-self-creation.sh
#   E2E_PORT=3200 E2E_MODEL=deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash scripts/e2e-skill-self-creation.sh
#
# Two profiles, because they are genuinely different systems:
#
#   E2E_PROFILE=local-dev (default)
#     `/projects` and `/projects/workspace` are HOST DISK, and the workspace root is the server's own
#     cwd. There is a real `builtin.shell` (LocalHost process backend). This is the shape a developer
#     runs, and the only shape where a skill's script has any chance of executing.
#
#   E2E_PROFILE=production
#     Every root -- `/tenants`, `/projects`, `/memory`, `/system/*` -- resolves to the DATABASE
#     (`production_database_root_filesystem`), so the workspace is DB-backed too and there is no host
#     disk. `HostedMultiTenant` + `SecureDefault` resolves to `ProcessBackendKind::None`, which strips
#     `builtin.shell` entirely. So a skill script CANNOT run here by policy, not by accident, and the
#     agent has exactly one namespace with nothing to disagree with it.
#
# Production mode needs a Postgres reachable at E2E_POSTGRES_URL (default: the local `reborn-pg`
# container this repo's docs use) and recreates its database, so never point it at anything real.
#
# Runs on its own port and its own IRONCLAW_REBORN_HOME, so it never disturbs a running dev server.
