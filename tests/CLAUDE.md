# Scenario Test Coverage Map

This document is the inventory of **every scenario test in the repo**, written in
plain English and mapped back to the exact file (and where useful, the exact test
name) that proves it. It answers two questions:

1. *Is this user-visible behavior already covered, and by what?*
2. *What is not covered yet?*

## MAINTENANCE RULE (non-negotiable)

**When you add, rename, delete, or materially re-scope a scenario test, update this
document in the SAME commit.**

- New `tests/integration/group_*/scenario_*.rs` → add a row to §3.
- New `tests/integration/<name>.rs` bin → add a row to §4.
- New `tests/integration/auth/<name>.rs` bin → add a row to §4.
- New `tests/*.rs` bin → add a row to §5.
- New `tests/e2e/scenarios/test_*.py` → add a row to §6.
- Closing a gap listed in §7 → delete that gap row and add the coverage row.
- Deleting/renaming a test → fix or remove the row that cites it; a row citing a
  file or test name that no longer exists is a broken document.

Rows describe **what a user can do or observe**, not what a function returns. If you
cannot write the row in one plain-English sentence, the test is probably asserting an
internal rather than a behavior — see `.claude/rules/testing.md`.

The counts in each section header are checked-in facts, not estimates. Update them.

## 1. Where scenarios live (tier map)

| Tier | Location | What is real | What is faked | Cost |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Group scenarios** (§3) | `tests/integration/group_*/scenario_*.rs` | whole Reborn turn, shared runtime + shared stores across several threads | the model, at the vendor-SDK seam | fast, offline, no setup |
| **Flat integration** (§4) | `tests/integration/*.rs`, `tests/integration/auth/*.rs` | whole Reborn turn, one thread; one dedicated sandbox test also uses a real local Docker worker | the model | usually fast/offline; sandbox worker test runs in its Docker CI lane |
| **Binary / parity / QA-trace** (§5) | `tests/*.rs` | composed runtime or shipping binary; recorded real-LLM traces | model responses replayed from committed traces | medium |
| **Python E2E** (§6) | `tests/e2e/scenarios/test_*.py` | current Reborn scenarios use real `ironclaw serve`, HTTP, and Playwright; retained legacy-fixture scenarios are pending migration | LLM (mock or recorded), external SaaS (Emulate/fakes) | slow |

Authoring guides: `tests/integration/CLAUDE.md` (Rust harness, group mechanics,
assertions) and `tests/e2e/CLAUDE.md` (pytest fixtures, Playwright, mock LLM).
Tier-selection rule: `.claude/rules/testing.md`.

## 3. Group scenarios — `tests/integration/group_*/` (51)

Multi-thread journeys over ONE shared runtime and ONE shared set of stores. These are
the canonical "a user does X in one conversation and sees the effect in another" tests.

### 3.1 Approvals — `group_approvals/` (10)

| The user can… | Evidence |
|---|---|
| Be asked to approve a risky file write, approve it, and watch the run finish | `scenario_gate_then_approve.rs` |
| Deny that same prompt and get a real answer back (not a hang) | `scenario_gate_then_deny.rs` |
| Say "always allow" once and never be asked again — including in a *different* conversation | `scenario_approve_always_persists_cross_thread.rs` |
| Have a tool marked "ask each time" prompt once per use and resume in one round trip (not re-prompt itself into a loop) | `scenario_ask_each_time_resumes_once.rs` |
| Approve/deny by replying in the channel ("approve"/"deny") rather than clicking a button | `scenario_submit_inbound_approval_resolution.rs` |
| Have two conversations waiting on approval at once, resolve them oppositely, and neither disturbs the other | `scenario_concurrent_dual_gate_resume.rs`, `scenario_concurrent_dual_gate_resume_parallel.rs` (also runs on libSQL) |
| Close the app with a prompt pending and still find it pending after reopen | `scenario_approval_request_persists_after_reopen.rs` |
| See the real reason a run failed instead of a generic "protocol violation" | `scenario_failure_category_demasked.rs` |
| Not resolve a gate with a stale/bogus reference, or resolve a gate that isn't there | `scenario_gate_ref_edge_cases.rs` |

### 3.2 Extensions — `group_extensions/` (14)

| The user can… | Evidence |
|---|---|
| Install an integration in one chat and see it active in another | `scenario_install_then_visible_cross_thread.rs`, `scenario_install_then_active_cross_thread.rs` |
| Remove an integration and have it gone everywhere | `scenario_remove_then_absent_cross_thread.rs` |
| Not call an integration's tools until it is actually installed | `scenario_uninstalled_tool_call_denied_until_active.rs` |
| Ask for an integration that doesn't exist and get a clear error rather than a crash | `scenario_install_unknown_extension_id_fails_safely.rs` |
| Get field-level repair guidance when the agent sends malformed install arguments | `scenario_malformed_lifecycle_arguments_are_structured.rs` |
| Be sent to a normal per-account sign-in when installing GitHub (no false "operator must configure this" wall) | `scenario_extension_install_github_normal_gate.rs` |
| Be told early and cleanly that Google isn't configured on this deployment — and sail through once an operator configures it | `scenario_extension_install_instance_not_configured.rs` |
| Be re-prompted to sign in when the provider revoked the grant, without a misleading tool error | `scenario_extension_install_reauth_gate.rs` |
| Install several Google apps and get an independent sign-in prompt per app, with the right scopes (a Gmail-only grant does not silently unlock Calendar) | `scenario_google_family_install_gate_and_shared_account.rs` |
| Finish personal setup and have their membership flip to active without a separate "activate" step | `scenario_existing_member_reinstall_reconciles_to_active.rs` |
| Connect Slack, use it, disconnect, reconnect, and use it again — with every surface (connection state, tools, page state) agreeing after each step | `scenario_slack_channel_lifecycle_state_machine.rs` |
| Restart the service and find Slack still connected | `scenario_slack_state_survives_reopen.rs` |
| Do the same install → use → remove → reconfigure → reinstall cycle for a credential-backed (GitHub) extension | `scenario_credential_extension_lifecycle_state_machine.rs` |

### 3.3 Multi-gate user journeys — `group_journeys/` (6)

| The user can… | Evidence |
|---|---|
| Approve a write, then deny a write, then keep chatting — with all three turns' history intact on one conversation | `scenario_interactive_approval_journey.rs` |
| Hit an approval prompt and a sign-in prompt in the same tool call, resolve both, then keep going across turns | `scenario_auth_then_approval_journey.rs` |
| Hit a sign-in prompt with no approval in the way, paste a token, and have the parked tool run for real | `scenario_auth_gate_grant_resume.rs` |
| Decline a sign-in, then sign in successfully later on the same conversation | `scenario_auth_deny_then_retry_journey.rs` |
| Have a stored-but-expired credential rejected, reconnect, and have the tool retry **with the new credential** | `scenario_expired_credential_resume.rs` |
| Not resolve another person's approval prompt — each user answers their own | `scenario_multi_actor_gate_isolation.rs` |

### 3.4 Memory — `group_memory/` (6)

| The user can… | Evidence |
|---|---|
| Have the assistant write a note in one chat and read it back in another | `scenario_write_then_read_cross_thread.rs` |
| Search memory from a different conversation and find what was written | `scenario_memory_search_finds_seeded.rs` |
| See the real folder structure of their memory | `scenario_memory_tree_reflects_structure.rs` |
| Run a build with memory disabled and have the assistant not even see memory tools | `scenario_disabled_binding_offers_no_memory_tools.rs` |
| Trust that only the memory hooks the provider declares actually fire | `scenario_lifecycle_gates_host_memory_calls.rs` |
| Ask a natural punctuated question in a new chat and receive explicitly saved memory — and only your own, never another user's — through the proactive prompt lane on the shipping libSQL backend | `scenario_proactive_prompt_recall_libsql.rs` |

### 3.5 Multi-user — `group_multiuser/` (5)

| The user can… | Evidence |
|---|---|
| Share one deployment with someone else and each keep their own threads | `scenario_two_actors_own_threads.rs` |
| Not read another user's memories (and still read their own) | `scenario_memory_isolation_across_actors.rs` |
| Not have another user's "always allow" apply to them | `scenario_auto_approve_isolation_across_actors.rs` |
| Not see another user's run/turn state | `scenario_turn_state_isolation_across_actors.rs` |
| On a per-caller-scoped (served) deployment: read their brand-new workspace as empty instead of an error, approve a gated write that lands in their own `tenants/{tenant}/users/{user}` subtree (never the shared root), and read it back — while a missing sub-path stays a hard error | `scenario_scoped_workspace_isolation.rs` |

### 3.6 Skills — `group_skills/` (1)

| The user can… | Evidence |
|---|---|
| List, install, and remove a skill, with each step visible from a different conversation | `scenario_install_list_remove.rs` |

### 3.7 Triggers & automations — `group_triggers/` (10)

| The user can… | Evidence |
|---|---|
| Create a scheduled automation, then pause/resume/remove it from another conversation | `scenario_verbs_lifecycle.rs` |
| Restart the service and still have their automation | `scenario_trigger_persists_after_reopen.rs` |
| Have a scheduled run ask for approval mid-fire and resume after they answer | `scenario_triggered_gate.rs` |
| Have a scheduled run chain through *two* approval prompts and still be recognised as a scheduled run | `scenario_triggered_chained_gate.rs` |
| See "waiting on you" on an automation whose run is parked, and see it clear when the run ends | `scenario_triggered_gate_hold_visible.rs` |
| Trust that a scheduled run can't create/remove/pause its own automations | `scenario_trigger_self_create_denied.rs` |
| Create an automation whose create input carries no delivery-routing field at all | `scenario_trigger_create_has_no_delivery_target_field.rs` |
| See and rename their automations in the WebUI, backed by the real trigger store | `scenario_webui_automations_list.rs`, `scenario_webui_automations_rename.rs` |

---

## 4. Flat integration bins — `tests/integration/*.rs` and `tests/integration/auth/*.rs` (55)

One thread, whole real turn. Grouped by what the user experiences.

**Chat & turn lifecycle**
| Behavior | Evidence |
|---|---|
| A plain message gets a persisted reply through the whole real stack | `greeting.rs` |
| Stopping a running turn actually stops it (Cancelled, not Completed) | `cancel.rs` |
| Typing again while the assistant is working queues the message and it gets picked up mid-run | `steering.rs` |
| A flaky model provider is retried and recovered from, with typed errors | `model_recovery.rs` |
| The exact prompt + tool surface sent to the model is snapshot-pinned per iteration | `golden_payload.rs` |
| Approaching the run limit surfaces a recoverable warning | `terminal_warning.rs` |
| Repeating the same inbound message does not start a second run | `idempotent_replay.rs` |
| Spend accounting fires on a real turn | `budget.rs` |
| Sub-agents spawn and awaiting them behaves at the edges | `subagent_await_edge.rs` |

**Tools**
| Behavior | Evidence |
|---|---|
| An HTTP tool call reaches the real egress boundary and the result reaches the model | `tool_call.rs`, `http_matcher.rs` |
| Saved, transcript-shaped JSON can be queried through scoped storage with plain or `$`-rooted paths; bounded collection operations can select the last item and aggregate numeric rows; invalid JSON produces model-visible correction guidance | `tool_call.rs` |
| Shell commands dispatch through the real path without spawning an OS process | `process_port.rs` |
| A sandbox-profile shell turn executes as an unprivileged user in a real Docker worker and keeps its workspace across calls | `reborn_sandbox_shell_turn.rs` |
| MCP tools work over a real loopback HTTP MCP server | `mcp.rs` |
| User-registered hosted MCP servers register, authenticate, restore, and invoke | `hosted_mcp_registration.rs` |
| Web search/fetch runs the real Exa MCP handshake | `web_access.rs` |
| Outbound HTTP crosses the real security pipeline (network policy + leak scan) | `real_egress_pipeline.rs` |
| Tools marked host-internal are never advertised to the model, and calls to them are rejected | `extension_visibility.rs`, `surface_disclosure.rs` |
| With a large tool catalog, bridged mode and the production default expose `tool_search`, `tool_describe`, and `tool_call` instead of flat tools | `tool_disclosure.rs` |
| Deferred tools can be found from argument-only vocabulary without adding that schema vocabulary to the model prompt | `tool_disclosure.rs::tool_search_discovers_authorized_tools_by_parameter_only_vocabulary` |
| Bridged disclosure never reintroduces host-runtime capability metadata excluded by any resolved host-API surface-policy dimension (ID, runtime, effect, approval, or maximum count) | `tool_disclosure.rs` |
| A capability whose lease expires mid-dispatch does not wedge the run | `lease_wedge.rs` |
| Attachments the user uploads are read back byte-for-byte by the model | `attach.rs` |
| Skill activation injects skill context into a real turn | `skill_activate.rs` |
| Creating a project through chat persists it | `project_create.rs` |
| Profile writes reach the real profile source | `profile.rs` |
| Delivery-target tools resolve through the real outbound service | `outbound_target.rs` |

**Auth** (`tests/integration/auth/`)
| Behavior | Evidence |
|---|---|
| A full OAuth connect → callback → stored account round trip | `auth/oauth_connect.rs` |
| Abandoning the OAuth popup, late callbacks, and retrying cleanly | `auth/oauth_popup_journeys.rs` |
| Idle credentials get refreshed by the background sweep | `auth/oauth_refresh.rs` |
| A missing credential parks a sign-in gate; denying it ends the run cleanly | `auth/auth_gate.rs` |
| A revoked/`invalid_grant` credential is marked revoked and read back as such | `auth/auth_failure.rs` |
| The service restarts while a gate is pending, and approving afterwards still resumes the run | `auth/reopen_resume_through_gate.rs` |
| Credentials are injected into the real outbound request (proof they reach the wire) | `secret_injection.rs` |

**Extensions & channels**
| Behavior | Evidence |
|---|---|
| An extension installs and activates through the real generic runtime | `extension_runtime.rs` |
| An inbound channel message is verified and routed by the real generic ingress mount | `extension_ingress.rs` |
| An outbound reply is delivered through the real inbound→outbound pipeline | `extension_delivery.rs` |
| A Telegram reply quotes the message it answers; a DM arriving mid-run gets an immediate busy notice quoting that DM, and the late reply still quotes its own prompt (#6643/#6644) | `extension_delivery.rs::unbound_telegram_actor_pairs_via_web_minted_code_then_turns_attribute_to_the_paired_user` (step 8 + anchored delivery evidence) |
| Tenant-admin configuration and per-user install/remove stay separate state machines | `extension_user_lifecycle_isolation.rs` |
| The model sees channel setup guidance but not UI-only chrome | `channel_connection_projection.rs` |
| Delivery preferences / connected channels render into the model prompt | `comm_context.rs` |

**Durability, storage & restart**
| Behavior | Evidence |
|---|---|
| Behavior is identical on in-memory and libSQL storage | `backend_matrix.rs` |
| Installed extensions survive a fresh store reopen | `durable.rs` |
| Secrets survive a genuine on-disk reopen | `secrets.rs` |
| Outbound preferences survive a process-level reopen | `outbound_store_durability.rs` |
| Restart sequences over a gated run recover correctly | `generated_restart_sequences.rs` |
| Odd gate sequences (double-resolve, cancel-after-finish, approve-a-done-run) behave | `generated_gate_sequences.rs` |

**Platform / wiring**
| Behavior | Evidence |
|---|---|
| Lifecycle hooks fire at the expected points and a hook deny blocks the tool without wedging | `hooks.rs` |
| Turn lifecycle events publish to subscribers; trace capture records them | `tracecap.rs`, `trace_capture.rs` |
| Instruction-safety context renders into the prompt | `safety.rs` |
| Scheduled-origin runs carry their origin into persisted state | `triggered_submit.rs` |
| The test harness's runtime wiring stays field-identical to production's | `wiring_parity.rs` |
| WebUI v2 routes work over the real services facade | `webui_v2_product_api.rs`, `webui_v2_router_smoke.rs` |
| Identity resolution runs on the coverage lane | `identity_resolution_smoke.rs` |

One of the 55 registered bins, `delivery_user_journeys.rs`, holds the explicit
channel-delivery journeys (two-lane model):

| A user can… | Scenario |
|---|---|
| Ask in WebUI to be pinged on Slack and get a bot delivery with provider evidence | `webui_send_me_on_slack_delivers_via_bot_with_evidence` |
| Ask from Slack for a Telegram delivery; ack lands in Slack, payload in Telegram | `slack_origin_delivers_to_telegram_and_acks_in_slack` |
| Never have the model deliver into the run's own conversation (lane 1 is automatic) | `deliver_to_origin_conversation_is_denied_and_model_replies` |
| See per-call honest results when one of several deliveries fails | `partial_failure_reports_per_call_honestly` |
| Get a refusal (no tool calls) for an undeliverable destination | `undeliverable_destination_is_refused_without_tool_calls` |
| Have a routine fire deliver via the tool with no stored target anywhere | `routine_fire_delivers_via_tool_without_stored_target` |
| Have a conditional fire that calls no delivery tool produce zero outbound attempts | `conditional_fire_with_no_delivery_call_produces_zero_attempts` |
| Get blocked-fire notices fanned out to every notification channel, first approve wins | `blocked_fire_fans_out_and_first_approve_wins` |
| Keep a blocked fire app-only when the notification-channel set is empty | `empty_notification_set_keeps_blocked_fire_in_app_only` |

---

## 5. Binary, parity & QA-trace bins — `tests/*.rs` (39)

**QA workflow phrases** — real manual-QA sentences, replayed against the Reborn binary.
| The user asks… | Evidence |
|---|---|
| "connect to <service>" and completes the auth flow | `reborn_qa_connect_flows.rs` (8) |
| "every 30 minutes email me a summary…" and gets a routine | `reborn_qa_routines.rs` (7) |
| a question in a Slack DM / a keyword-prefixed message, and gets a Slack reply | `reborn_qa_channel_delivery.rs` (2) |
| "use this Google Drive doc as your knowledge base" | `reborn_qa_doc_grounding.rs` (2) |
| "does api.github.com return 200 / summarize this release page" | `reborn_qa_web_fetch.rs` (3) |
| any of the above, replayed from committed real-LLM traces | `reborn_qa_recorded_behavior.rs` (29) |
| "send me XYZ every morning" from the web app and gets a routine whose fires stay in the run thread (no delivery step — the source-surface default, live-recorded) | `reborn_qa_recorded_behavior.rs::contract_routine_bare_send_me_from_web_app_pins_no_delivery_step` (+ replay) |
| "send me XYZ to Slack and Telegram" and gets a routine whose prompt pins one delivery step per channel (live-recorded) | `reborn_qa_recorded_behavior.rs::contract_routine_multi_channel_delivery_pins_both_targets_in_prompt` (+ replay) |
| a broad smoke set of whole turns on a full runtime | `reborn_qa_smoke_scenarios_e2e.rs` (10) |

**Binary-level behavior**
| Behavior | Evidence |
|---|---|
| A provider failure yields a sanitized, *retryable* failure and the user can retry and resume | `reborn_failure_retry_resume_e2e.rs` (6) |
| Sub-agents spawn end-to-end | `reborn_subagent_spawn_e2e.rs` (5) |
| The shipped Docker image has a usable runtime home | `dockerfile_runtime_home.rs` (19) |
| Live GitHub API contracts still hold (ignored canary, needs a real PAT) | `reborn_live_github_pat_contract.rs` |

**Scope isolation parity** — one bin per boundary; each proves data from one scope is
unreachable from another: `reborn_agent_scope_isolation_parity.rs`,
`reborn_project_scope_isolation_parity.rs`,
`reborn_identity_{tenant,project,prompt}_scope_isolation_parity.rs`,
`reborn_tenant_binding_scope_isolation_parity.rs`,
`reborn_thread_binding_isolation_parity.rs`,
`reborn_direct_chat_user_scope_isolation_parity.rs`,
`reborn_http_network_scope_isolation_parity.rs`,
`reborn_adapter_installation_scope_isolation_parity.rs`,
`reborn_wrong_scope_access_isolation_parity.rs`.

**Trace parity** — recorded-trace equivalence for tool families and error paths:
`reborn_trace_core_builtin_tools_parity.rs`, `reborn_trace_file_tools_parity.rs`,
`reborn_trace_coding_read_tools_parity.rs`, `reborn_trace_error_path_parity.rs`,
`reborn_trace_wasm_github_fixture_parity.rs`,
`reborn_trace_first_party_tool_coverage.rs` (10),
`reborn_recorded_trace_parity.rs`, `reborn_minimal_dispatch_parity.rs`,
`reborn_response_order_parity.rs`, `reborn_tool_param_coercion_parity.rs`,
`reborn_approval_traces_parity.rs`, `reborn_turn_state_lock_free_submit_parity.rs`.

**Policy & format**: `e2e_trace_runtime_policy_org_ceiling_yolo.rs` (org policy
ceiling × yolo narrowing), `e2e_trace_runtime_policy_serde.rs` (wire-stable policy
enums), `trace_format.rs`, `trace_llm_tests.rs`,
`reborn_coverage_lane_stack_headroom.rs` (CI job must declare stack headroom).

## 6. Python E2E scenarios — `tests/e2e/scenarios/` (103 files, 1,141 tests)

This is an exhaustive inventory, not a claim that every retained scenario is
currently executable. Current Reborn coverage starts `ironclaw serve` through the
`reborn_v2_*` fixtures or exercises a current provider/API harness. Any cited test
that still uses `ironclaw_binary`, `ironclaw_server`, or the legacy `page`/`SEL`
fixtures is inventory-only, non-functional, and pending migration under #6369 —
even when it appears beside current Reborn evidence in the same row. See
`tests/e2e/CLAUDE.md` §"Reborn E2E coverage gate" before adding coverage-manifest
entries.

### 6.1 Chat, shell & session
| The user can… | Evidence |
|---|---|
| Load the app, sign in with a token, navigate, and be rejected without one | `test_reborn_webui_v2_legacy_core.py`, `test_reborn_webui_v2_smoke.py::test_reborn_v2_serves_shell_and_gates_auth` |
| Send a message and see a streamed reply; empty messages don't send | `test_reborn_webui_v2_legacy_core.py::test_reborn_legacy_core_send_message_and_receive_response`, `…::test_reborn_legacy_core_empty_message_not_sent` |
| See their message immediately, keep it through a reconnect/reload, and not see it duplicated once confirmed | `test_reborn_webui_v2_legacy_pending_messages.py` (12), `test_pending_user_messages.py` (8) |
| Reload the page and still see history, tool cards, and in-progress turns | `test_reborn_webui_v2_legacy_sse_history.py` (10), `test_reborn_webui_v2_legacy_message_persistence.py`, `test_message_persistence.py` (10) |
| Type a draft while a run is processing | `test_reborn_webui_v2_smoke.py::test_reborn_v2_composer_accepts_draft_while_run_is_processing` |
| Click "+ New" or open a thread and start typing immediately — focus lands in the composer without a second click | `test_reborn_webui_v2_smoke.py::test_reborn_v2_composer_takes_focus_from_sidebar_navigation` |
| Start a new chat while a run is active (the #5256 deadlock regression) | `test_reborn_webui_v2_smoke.py` |
| Page through older messages/threads without losing scroll position | `test_reborn_webui_v2_smoke.py::test_reborn_v2_timeline_pagination`, `…::test_reborn_v2_loading_older_messages_preserves_viewport` |
| Keep DOM bounded on huge histories, without SSE timer leaks | `test_reborn_webui_v2_legacy_dom_resource_limits.py` (4) |
| Copy a message, use the command palette | `test_reborn_webui_v2_legacy_chat_actions.py` (3) |
| Delete a thread behind a shared confirmation dialog | `test_reborn_webui_v2_smoke.py::test_reborn_v2_thread_delete_uses_shared_confirmation_dialog` |
| Collapse the sidebar, pick a theme, pick a language — and have it persist | `test_reborn_webui_v2_smoke.py` |
| Opt into the inspector for the browser session, toggle it from the header icon, preserve its selected tab while closing, resizing, reloading, and reconnecting after visibility changes, explicitly disable it, and leave the ordinary chat shell unchanged when debug mode is off | `test_reborn_webui_v2_smoke.py::test_inspector_debug_activation_and_responsive_shell` |
| Inspect the bounded host-resolved prompt, ordered activity timeline, turn navigation, and model-call statistics for completed runs, including continued diagnostic observation while the panel is closed | `test_reborn_webui_v2_smoke.py::test_inspector_prompt_and_stats_render_host_diagnostics` |
| Reconnect SSE without gaps or duplicates; multiple tabs both get the reply; excess connections are rate-limited | `test_reborn_webui_v2_legacy_sse_history.py`, `test_reborn_webui_v2_streaming_run_control_api.py` (10) |
| Keep execution-only engine threads out of the chat sidebar while preserving deep-linked history | `test_v2_thread_visibility.py` (2; pending legacy migration #6369) |

### 6.2 Tools, approvals & auth prompts (UI)
| The user can… | Evidence |
|---|---|
| Run built-in tools, parallel calls, and multi-step chains and see the result | `test_reborn_webui_v2_legacy_tool_execution.py` (9), `test_v2_engine_tool_lifecycle.py` (6), `test_tool_execution.py` |
| Inspect safely bounded arguments and a visibly truncated 50 KiB output for a completed tool call | `test_reborn_webui_v2_tool_gates.py::test_reborn_v2_tool_turn_records_result_and_final_reply` |
| Recover when a tool fails, a tool call is truncated, or the model loops | `test_reborn_webui_v2_legacy_tool_execution.py`, `test_agent_loop_recovery.py` (4), `test_v2_engine_error_handling.py` |
| See the approval card with payload details, approve/deny, and see it disable while resolving | `test_reborn_webui_v2_legacy_approval.py` (8) |
| Not send messages while a gate is pending — but keep using other threads | `test_reborn_webui_v2_legacy_approval.py::test_reborn_legacy_pending_approval_does_not_block_other_thread` |
| Approve/deny/always from Slack or Telegram DMs, and resolve a channel gate from the web | `test_channel_approval_gates.py` (9) |

## 7. Known gaps

Derived from the inventory above. "Gap" here means *no scenario-tier test exists*; some
of these are covered at crate tier, which is a weaker but real signal — say so if you
verify it.

| Gap | Notes |
|---|---|
| **Proactive / background execution** has no Reborn scenario at any tier | The v1 heartbeat loop has no Reborn equivalent yet — issue #6369. Nothing in §3–§6 drives it. |
| **Skills** have only one group scenario (`install_list_remove`) | No group-tier coverage of skill activation under a gate, install failure/denial, or trusted-vs-installed tool attenuation. Attenuation rules are in `.claude/rules/skills.md`. |
| **Telegram** has no group-tier lifecycle scenario | Slack has `scenario_slack_channel_lifecycle_state_machine.rs`; Telegram's setup resolves through a pairing mechanism the bare group harness doesn't mount (see `scenario_extension_install_github_normal_gate.rs`'s module doc). Telegram is covered at the Python tier only. |
| **Memory deletion / retention** is uncovered | `group_memory/` covers write, read, search, tree, and binding gating — nothing covers removal, eviction, or the "LLM data is never deleted" invariant from the root `CLAUDE.md`. |
| **Cross-actor isolation for triggers and extensions** is thin at group tier | `group_multiuser/` covers threads, memory, auto-approve and turn state. Extensions get one `with_actor_id` scenario; triggers get none. |
| **Attachments** have no group scenario | Covered flat (`attach.rs`) and in the browser (`test_reborn_webui_v2_legacy_attachments.py`), but not cross-thread/cross-actor. |
| **Sub-agents** have no group scenario | `reborn_subagent_spawn_e2e.rs` + `subagent_await_edge.rs` only. |
| **Python E2E skip/xfail debt** | Tracked separately in `tests/e2e/E2E_DEBT.md` (ClawHub skills, legacy Gmail/MCP OAuth prerequisites, Telegram OAuth placeholders, portfolio widget, v2 auth/OAuth xfails). Do not silently un-xfail. |
| **Live-model tool-misuse patterns** are documented but not gated | `tests/e2e/LIVE_TOOL_FAILURES.md` — the assistant claiming a write it never made, etc. No test fails on these today. |
| **Observability** has no scenario coverage | `crates/substrates/ironclaw_observability` is latency-trace macros over `tracing` only — there is no exporter backend to exercise. |

## 8. Adding a scenario

1. Pick the tier from §1 and `.claude/rules/testing.md`. Integration-first: production-wired
   Reborn behavior ships with a test in `tests/integration/`.
2. **Extend an existing scenario before writing a new one.** If you add one, the row you
   write in this document must explain why an existing scenario couldn't absorb it.
3. Write it test-first — watch it fail for the right reason.
4. Register the binary if it's a new Rust bin (`[[test]]` in the workspace `Cargo.toml`).
5. **Add the row here.** See the maintenance rule at the top.
